    <h1>Image description for castle diagram:</h1>
    <p>This is an image description for:</p>
    <div><img src="castle-diagram.jpg"
      alt="castle diagram" width="500" height="264" /></div>
    <p>The image is taken from an eighteenth-Century
      engraving in which the various parts
      of a castle are identified by numbers. Text in the
      engraving gives a name for each numbered part
      of the castle.</p>
    <p>The castle consists of a square central tower some
      four or five storeys high, with square turrets at
      each corner and in the middle of the wall visible in
      the picture. There is also a flagpole on top of this building,
      and there are battlements (castellation) around the top of
      the roof.  The entire castle is drawn as if seen from a
      building slightly taller than this central tower and
      some distance away, although this is obviously a
      fictional vantage point.  The castle itself is also
      probably fictional, not representing any specific
      location.</p>
    <p>Surrounding the square tower are three concentric stone
      walls, also with castellations or arrow-slits at the top
      of the walls. There are out-buildings in the space between
      the two smallest rings of wall and a complex gate with
      turrets on the outermost ring.</p>
    <p>The parts are labeled as follows:</p>`
    <dl>
      <dt>1. The Barbacan.</dt>
      <dd><p>This is a gate with two turrets set entirely outside
      the main walls; it defends the bridge over
      moat leading to the outermost wall.</p></dd>
      <dt>2. The Ditch or Moat.</dt>
      <dd><p>The ditch runs all the way round the outer
	stone wall.
	It is difficult to judge its depth from the picture,
	but it coulf be anywhere from three feet (one metre) deep
	to two or three times that depth. It might also have water
	in it, although again that is not very clear in the picture.</p></dd>
      <dt>3. Wall of the outer Ballium.</dt>
      <dd><p>This is the outermost wall, just inside the ditch or
	(if filled with water) the moat. The wall appears to be
	a little over two meters (six feet) high and consists
	of straight segments perhaps twnety feet long joined
	at angles to make a large rough circle shape. There are
	towers at most of the corners, some square and some circular.
	The towers are of varying heights,
	perhaps between ten and twenty feet,
	with arrow-slits in the walls around the roof of each tower.</p>
      <p>The number 3 is engraved
	on the diagram
	just behind the barbican gate (number 1), where an
	arched entrance in the wall is protected by a
	circular turret rising up from that same wall, and 
	connects the area inside the outer Ballium with a
	bridge over the moat leading to the inside of the
	main entrance, the Barbican.</p></dd>

      <dt>4. Outer Ballium.</dt>
      <dd><p>The Outer Ballium is the space between the outermost
      stone wall and the middle stone wall. 
      The two outwemost walls are perhaps some tenty feet (seven meters) apart
      from each other. The ground is drawn as flat, using wiggly lines
      of shading, although on the left-hand side there is a hill.</p></dd>
      <dt>5. Artificial Mount.</dt>
      <dd><p>This artificial mont, or mound, is a round hill perhpas ten
	feet (three meters) high, on the left side of the pictuer,
	nestling up against the middle wall and
	almost large enough to reach the outer wall.
	The walls go upward to account for the height of the mound.
	There is a square tower built in to the middle wall at
	the top of the hill.</p></dd>
      <dt>6. Wall of the Inner Ballium.</dt>
      <dd>
	<p>The middle wall is labeled in the diagram as the
	  wall of the Inner Ballium; the Inner Ballium is the space between
	  the two innermost walls.</p>
	<p>This middle wall is about the same height and nature as
	  the outer wall. It has an arched entrance protected by a circular
	  tower built into the wall. At the right hand end of the wall
	  is a square tower. The wall makes an abrupt right-angled turn
	  at that tower, contuing in its circuit towards the back of
	  the castle. The back left corner of that very rough circle is also
	  a right angle, just like the front right corner, so this middle
	  wall would be somewhat diamond shaped in a plan view.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>7. Inner Ballium.</dt>
      <dd>
	<p>The Inner Ballium is the area between the middle wall and
	  the smallest ring. The two smallest walls are much further apart
	  than the two outermost walls, making the Inner Ballium into
	  a larger space.
	  There are maybe five or six out-buildings in
	  this space, one of which, near the back left, has a tower
	  and might be intended to represent a small church.</p>
      </dd>
      <dt>8. Keep or Dungeon.</dt>
      <dd><p>The Keep is the square tower in the center of th diagram.
	It has a wall going round it that, judging by the part that
	is visible, is probably six-sided.
	The wall has towers at each corner and a small entrance-way in
	the middle of one wall. It is not clear in the diagram wither
	the entrance is small or whether it has been drawn smaller than the
	others because it is further away: the artist did not have strong
	perspective skills.</p>
      <p>Neither the innermost wall nor the space between that wall and
	the Keep are labeled in the diagram.</p>
