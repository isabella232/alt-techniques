    <section>
      <h2 id="introduction">Introduction</h2>
      <p>The HTML <code>alt</code> attribute can be placed on any
	<code>img</code> element.
	Its content should provide
	a short textual description of the image that can be presented
	to a user in the case that the image is not
	viewed or to software that processes text.
	The descriptions are useful when images are not displayed
	and also for users who are unable to view images.
	The descriptions may also be used by web search engines
	and in-page user agent searches.</p>
    </section>

    <section>
      <h2 id="alt">Providing text to act as an alternative for images</h2>
      <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#text-altdef">Text alternatives</a> [[WCAG20]] are a primary way of making visual information accessible.
	Text alternatives allow the information to be rendered
	in a variety of ways by a variety of user agents.
	For example,
	a person who cannot see a picture can have the text alternative read aloud using synthesized speech.
	The <code>alt</code> attribute, along with the <code>longdesc</code> attribute [[!HTML-LONGDESC]], is an essential part of making accessible
	documents as well as providing for text-based search engines
	and other consumers of HTML.</p>

      <p>In order to write alternate content such as that found in
	<code>alt</code> attribute values, authors must consider
	not only the image itself but also
	both the context in which the image appears and the function the image may have in that context.
	The same image may need different
	<code>alt</code> text in different contexts.
	The following sections give some principles for writing text alternatives
	with the <code>alt</code> attribute and suggest when to use the <code>longdesc</code>
	attribute to provide ore detail; these principles
	are then illustrated by examples.
	Additional guidance and techniques are available in <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/alt/">Resources on Alternative Text for Images</a>.</p>

       <section>
       <h3 id="alt-technical-constraints">Technical Constraints</h3>

	 <p>Because <code>alt</code> is an HTML attribute there are some restrictions on
	   what it can contain and how it can be used:</p>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-lang">Language of Alternate Text</h4>
	   <p>The language of the attribute value cannot be marked as being
	     different from that of the image element itself. This is not usually
	     a problem in practice unless the image element was supplied by
	     automated language-based document assembly; use the
	     <code>lang</code> (and for the XML syntax the <code>xml:lang</code> attribute)
	     to mark the language of the alternate text if it differs from that of
	     the surrounding text.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-plaintext">Sub-elements not available in Alternate Text</h4>
	   <p>Attributes are plain text and cannot contain sub-elements.
	   In particular this also means that fragments of MathML or SVG
	   cannot be included in an <code>alt</code> attribute value, and
	   that emphasis cannot be used.</p>
	  </section>

	  <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-overflow">Effective Length Limits on Alternate Text</h4>
	   <p>The value of the <code>alt</code> attribute will generally be
	     rendered by an HTML user agent as replacement text
	     in place of a broken or unavailable
	     image, or if image display is disabled, or in a text-mode browser.
	     The replacement text will usually be rendered in the space reserved
	     for the image. If the text does not fit in the available space,
	     some user agents will truncate the text and others might not
	     display the text at all, reducing accessibility and usability
	     of the document for sighted users in the case that images were
	     not available.</p>
	   <p>In at least some agents the CSS <code>overflow</code> property
	     may be used to allow the alternate text to extend outside
	     the width and height allocated for the <code>img</code> element.</p>
	  </section>

	  <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-restrict-no-difference">No differentiation From Surrounding Text</h4>
	   <p>Text readers will generally read out the value of the
	     <code>alt</code> attribute
	     every time it is encountered, and may or may not provide the
	     user with a way to skip to the end of the alternate text and
	     to carry on reading out the document just after the image element.
	     This means that documents should not contain overly
	     burdensome alternate text even if it might fit in the available
	     space.</p>
	   <p>For visual differentiation, CSS styles such as
	     <code>color</code> can be applied to the <code>img</code> element.</p>

	   <p>Text that is for use as an alternative to an image but that
	     contains formatting or markup (such as tables or equations),
	     needs to be made available separately as described in the next
	     section,
	     <a href="#principles-for-providing-text-alternatives">Principles for
	       providing text alternatives</a>. In this case a short text
	     alternative, such as <code>Maxwell's Equations</code>, should be
	     used in the <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>
	  </section>

       </section>

       <section>
       <h3 id="principles-for-providing-text-alternatives">Principles For
	 Providing Text Alternatives</h3>

	 <p>Even though there are restrictions on its value, the
	   <code>alt</code> attribute is still needed in order to make
	   documents properly accessible.
	   This section describes general principles for authors and
	   developers to use when considering the use of the
	   <code>alt</code> attribute, the
	   <code>longdesc</code> attribute, and also the newer
	   ARIA <code>described-by</code> and <code>described-at</code>
	   attributes. [[!WAI-ARIA]]</p>

	 <p class="note">The Web Accessibility Initiative provides
	   <a href="http://www.w3.org/WAI/tutorials/images/decision-tree/">An
	     alt Decision Tree</a> to help authors decide what to put
	   into an <code>alt</code> attribute value.</p>

	 <h4 id="alt-guideline-purpose">Functional images: State the Purpose</h4>
	 <p>Where an image has a function, such as a button to press, or serves
	   a clear purpose such as identifying the maker of a page by a company
	   logo, be direct and simply give the purpose, such as <q>Make Payment</q>
	   or <q>W3C Logo</q>.</p>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guideline-characters">Images As Text: Give the text</h4>
	   <p>If an image is used to stand for a special character, emoji, gaiji,
	     itaiji, emoticon, or text in an unusual font, the alt text should
	     simply be the text that is on the image, or a textual equivalent
	     such as <code>:-)</code> for a smiling face.</p>
	   <p class="note">In many cases Web fonts can be used instead of images,
	     and, provided that the fonts are correctly encoded and that the
	     characters represented are in Unicode, user agents that do not use
	     the fonts will still render the correct text.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guideline-mathematics">Images of Equations and Tables</h4>
	   <p>Recommended practice is to mark up mathematical equations
	     with MathML; if this is not possible, sometimes a picture
	     of an equation is used. Similarly even complex tables can
	     usually be marked up in HTML directly, but sometimes a
	     picture is used instead.  In these and similar cases the
	     alt attribute should be given a value such as <q>Equation 7</q>
	     or <q>Table of wandering monsters by level</q>.
	     Since people seeing the image would not want to read the
	     same content in two different forms, the information in the
	     equation or table picture should then be presented in an
	     external document, pointed to with a URI as the value of
	     <code>longdesc</code> attribute, for example
	     <code>longdesc</code> <code>=</code> <code>equation007.html</code>.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guideline-charts-and-diagrams">Charts and Diagrams</h4>
	   <p>It is often possible to represent charts, diagrams and other
	     explanatory sorts of picture using SVG. This does not automatically
	     make such pictures be accessible, but different mechanisms then
	     become available for embedding text alternatives in the SVG images.</p>
	   <p>If SVG is for some reason not used then the same considerations
	     as for <a href="#alt-guideline-mathematics">images of equations and
	       tables</a>
	     generally apply. A description of a diagram, however, may need to
	     include information about the presentation as well as the
	     information.  For example, a government report in an archival
	     format might mention the colors used in a bar chart
	     in order to facilitate subsequent discussions.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guidelines-simple-images">Simple Images</h4>
	   <p>Where an image or diagram can be described adequately
	     with a short piece of plain text that would easily fit
	     in the space otherwise occupied by the image,
	     that text should be used for the text alternative.</p>
	 </section>

	 <section>
	   <h4 id="alt-guidelines-decorative">Decorative and Pieced Images</h4>
	   <p>If an image is purely decorative, it is not necessary to give
	     it alt text; use an empty value for the
	     <code>alt</code> attribute.
	     If the image separates words of text an alternative text
	     of a single space might be appropriate.</p>
	   <p>When multiple images are placed together, for
	     example to make up a frame or border or when a
	     complex image is split into smaller images, only
	     the first image should normally have explanatory
	     text, in order to avoid tedious repetition from
	     a screen reader.</p>
	   </section>
	 </section>
       <section>
	<h3 id="examples-of-scenarios-where-users-benefit-from-text-alternatives-for-images">Examples of scenarios where users benefit from text alternatives for images</h3>
	<ul>
	  <li>They have a slow connection and are browsing with images disabled.</li>
	  <li>They have a vision impairment and use text to speech software.</li>
	  <li>They have a cognitive impairment and use text to speech software.</li>
	  <li>They are using a text-only browser.</li>
	  <li>They are listening to the page being read out by a voice Web browser.</li>
	  <li>They have images disabled to save on download costs.</li>
	  <li>They have problems loading images or the source of an image is wrong.</li>
	  <li>They are in an environment where focusing upon a screen is challenging and/or dangerous, and having the content read to them is a safer alternative (e.g., driving a vehicle).</li>
	</ul>
	</section>
	<section>
	<h3 id="general-guidelines">General guidelines</h3>
	<p>Except where otherwise specified, the <code>alt</code> attribute MUST be specified and its value MUST NOT be empty. When specified, the value MUST be an appropriate functional replacement for the image. The specific requirements for the <code>alt</code> attribute content    depend on the image's function in the page, as described in the following sections.</p>
	<p>To determine an appropriate text alternative it is important to think about why an image is being included in a page. What is its purpose? Thinking like this will help you to understand what is important about the image for the intended audience. Every image has a reason for being on a page, because it provides useful information, performs a function, labels an interactive element, enhances aesthetics or is purely decorative. Therefore, knowing what the image is for makes writing an appropriate text alternative easier.</p>

	<h3 id="graphical-representations:-charts,-diagrams,-graphs,-maps,-illustrations">Graphical Representations: Charts, diagrams, graphs, maps, illustrations</h3>
	<p>Readers can benefit when content is presented in graphical form, for example as a flowchart, a diagram, a graph, or a map showing directions.
	  People unable to see the image for any reason will
	  need the information provided in another form.</p>
	<p>Diagrams often convey a lot of information. This means that
	  a textual alternative may be quite lengthy.  The content of the
	  <code>alt</code> attribute is in general limited to the amount
	  of text that will fit in the space normally occupied by
	  the image.  In addition, it may be tedious for someone
	  listening to an audio rendition of a Web page to have to skip
	  over a lengthy description each time they reach the diagram.</p>
	<p>An appropriate technique, then, is to have a short description
	  in the <code>alt</code> attribute, such as
	  <code>bar chart of product sales by region</code>, and
	  to link to a longer image description.</p>
	<p>An <em>image description</em> in this context is text,
	  whether embedded in the main document or elsewhere, that
	  would enable a reader to have a good idea of what the image
	  looks like. This is different from an
	  <em>alternate representation</em> in that, for example,
	  it might mention that a pie chart is circular or that the
	  items in a bar chart are horizontal rows, and should mention
	  any significant colors. Such a description can enable people
	  to participate in conversations about the image, or to
	  answer examination questions that might rely on the
	  way the information is represented and not just the underlying
	  data.</p>

      <h4>Using the alt attribute with an external image description</h4>
	<p>An external image description is just another document, normally
	in HTML, that describes an image.
	You should consider using an external image description if
	one of more of the following applies:</p>
	<ul>
	  <li>The description would not interest people able
	  to see the image itself;</li>
	  <li>The description might be lengthy enough to annoy people
	  who can see the image, or confuse people reading the page;</li>
	  <li>The description is provided by a third party, for example
	  for diagrams in examination questions.</li>

      <h4>Using the alt attribute with an associated text alternative</h4>
      <p>A text alternative presents the same essential information
      as a diagram or illustration but in a text format accessible
      in cases where the image is not seen or used. It is normally contained
      in the same document as the image.
      You should supply a text alternative in addition to the alt attribute
	  in these circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
	  <li>The information takes more than a few words to describe but
	  is still of use to someone who can see the image.</li>
	  <li>A user might reasonably want to select the text alternative, or
	  to find it with a browser search function, regardless of whether
	  the image is displayed.</li>
	  <li>The text alternative requires structured markup such as MathML,
	  tables, emphasis, multiple paragraphs, links, or Japanese ruby annotations.
	  Attributes such as alt cannot contain elements.</li>
	  <li>The text alternative is not in the same language
	  as the main document.
	  Attributes such as alt cannot be marked with xml:lang for
	  language.</li>
      </ul>

    <div class="example" name="castle-digram-id">
      <p>The following example is a diagram of a castle.
	The diagram is taken from a book of historical
	significance, and hence is a raster image rather than
	being represented in a vector graphic format such as SVG.
	As with many diagrams, there are two main parts to this example.
	The first is a picture,
	in this case a drawing of a castle.  The second part is a set of
	labels, identifying some of the components of the castle so that they
	may more easily be described in the text. In this case the
	labels are numbers on the diagram itself, with a separate table
	giving a name corresponding to each number.</p>
      <p><img alt="castle diagram" longdesc="images/castle-diagram-d.html"
	src="images/castle-diagram.jpg" width="500" height="264"></p>
      <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;img src="castle-diagram.jpg"
	  alt="castle diagram" longdesc="castle-diagram-d.html&gt;</pre>
      <p>It is not appropriate to try to put descriptions of complex
	diagrams into alt images, so a short mnemonic label is used;
	the longer description is in a separate file. It might include
	text such as the following:</p>
      <div class="code">
	<p>Image description for castle diagram:</p>
	<p>The image is taken from an eighteenth-Century
	  engraving in which the various parts
	  of a castle are identified by numbers. Text in the
	  engraving gives a name for each numbered part
	  of the castle.</p>
	<p>The castle consists of a square central tower some
	  four or five storeys high, with square turrets at
	  each corner and in the middle of the wall visible in
	  the picture. There is also a flagpole on top of this building,
	  and there are battlements (castellation) around the top of
	  the roof.  The entire castle is drawn as if seen from a
	  building slightly taller than this central tower and
	  some distance away, although this is obviously a
	  fictional vantage point.  The castle itself is also
	  probably fictional, not representing any specific
	  location.</p>
	<p>Surrounding the square tower are three concentric stone
	  walls, also with castellations or arrow-slits at the top
	  of the walls. There are out-buildings in the space between
	  the two smallest rings of wall and a complex gate with
	  turrets on the outermost ring.</p>
	<p>The parts are labeled as follows:</p>
	<dl>
	  <dt>1. The Barbacan.</dt>
	  <dd><p>This is a gate with two turrets set entirely outside
	  the main walls; it defends the bridge over
	  moat leading to the outermost wall.</p></dd>
	  <dt>2. The Ditch or Moat.</dt>
	  <dd><p>The ditch runs all the way round the outer
	    stone wall.</p></dd>
	  <dt>3. Wall of the outer Ballium.</dt>
	  <dd><p>This is the outermost wall. It appears to be
	    a little over two meters (six feet) high and consists
	    of straight segments perhaps twenty feet long joined
	    at angles to make a large rough circle shape. There are
	    towers at most of the corners, some square and some circular.
	    The towers are of varying heights,
	    perhaps between ten and twenty feet,
	    with arrow-slits in the walls around the roof of each tower.</p>
	  <p>The number 3 is engraved
	    on the diagram
	    just behind the barbican gate (number 1), where an
	    arched entrance in the wall is protected by a
	    circular turret rising up from that same wall, and
	    connects the area inside the outer Ballium with a
	    bridge over the moat leading to the inside of the
	    main entrance, the Barbican.</p></dd>
	</dl>
    </div><!-- /code *-->
      </div>
      <p>The actual image description continues
	in the same manner until all of the parts of
	the castle picture are described.
	Depending on the context in
	which the illustration is used the description could also mention
	that the diagram is
	printed with dark brown ink on a yellowish-white paper,
	and even that the edges of the printing-block have left visible lines to
	the left and top of the picture.</p>
      <p>Information that is likely also to be of use (or interest) to people who are able
	to see the image should normally be in the
	main document; an example might be the names of the
	artist and engraver; for a photograph, technical
	information about the camera lens and exposure would
	similarly not be suitable for an external image description,
	because it is not provided as a substitute for the image
	but to give additional information. Information that is likely to
	be irrelevant or tedious for people who can see the image but
	that would be necessary for understanding concepts illustrated should
	be in the external image description.</p>

      <h4>Using the alt attribute with an associated text alternative</h4>
      <p>You should supply a text alternative in addition to the alt attribute
	  in these circumstances:</p>
      <ul>
	  <li>The text alternative is more than a few words long, or is complex
	  or detailed.</li>
	  <li>A user might reasonably want to select the text alternative, or
	  to find it with a browser search function.</li>
	  <li>The text alternative requires structured markup such as MathML,
	  emphasis, multiple paragraphs, links, or Japanese ruby annotations.
	  Attributes such as alt cannot contain elements.</li>
	  <li>The text alternative might need to be translated into other
	  languages, or is not in the same language as the main document.
	  Attributes such as alt cannot be marked with xml:lang for
	  language.</li>
      </ul>
      <p>Although the alt attribute is essential to enable someone to understand
	  which image was not rendered, it should not be relied on to convey
	  detailed content.</p>

      <div class="example">
        <p>Here's an example of a flowchart image, with a short text alternative     included in the <code>alt</code> attribute, in this case the text alternative is a description of the link target     as the image is the sole content of a link. The link points to a description, within the same document, of the     process represented in the flowchart.</p>

        <p>In this example, there is an image of a chart.

  Once <code>figure</code> and <code>figcaption</code> are accessibility supported in browsers, the addition of ARIA attributes will not be required.<p class="note">For any of the examples in this section the <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code>

  <p class="warning">The <code>details</code> and <code>summary</code> elements are not well supported by browsers, until such times they are supported, if used, you will need to use scripting to provide the functionality. There are a number of scripted polyfills available and also scripted custom controls are available, in popular JavaScript UI widget libraries, which provide similar functionality.</p>

   <h3 id="images-of-text">Images of text</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, an image only contains  text, and the purpose of the image     is to display text  using visual effects and /or fonts.  It is <em>strongly</em> recommended that text styled using CSS be used, but if this is not possible, provide     the same text in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-img-alt">alt</a> attribute as is in the image.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>This example shows an image of the text "Get Happy!" written in a fancy multi colored freehand style.     The image makes up the content of a heading. In this case the text alternative for the image is "Get Happy!".</p>
        <p><img alt="Get Happy!" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/text.png" height="77" width="275"></p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;h1&gt;&lt;img src="gethappy.gif" <mark>alt="Get Happy!"</mark>&gt;&lt;/h1&gt;</pre>
      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <p>In this example we have an advertising image consisting of text,   the phrase "The BIG sale" is     repeated 3 times, each time the text gets smaller and fainter, the   last line reads "...ends Friday"     In the context of use, as an advertisement, it is recommended that   the image's text alternative only include the text "The BIG sale"     once as the repetition is for visual effect and the repetition of the   text for users who cannot view     the image is unnecessary and could be confusing.</p>
        <p><img alt="The big sale ...ends Friday." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/sale.png" height="190" width="400"></p>
        <pre class="example highlight">&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="sale.gif" <mark>alt="The BIG sale ...ends Friday."</mark>&gt;&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
        <p>In situations where there is also a photo or other graphic along with the image of text,      ensure that the words in the image text are included in the text alternative, along with any other description      of the image that conveys meaning to users who can view the image, so the information is also      available to users who cannot view the image.</p>
      </div>
      <p>When an image is used to represent a character that cannot otherwise be represented in Unicode,    for example gaiji, itaiji, or new characters such as novel currency symbols, the text alternative    should be a more conventional way of writing the same thing, e.g. using the phonetic hiragana or    katakana to give the character's pronunciation.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>In this example from 1997, a new-fangled currency symbol that looks like a curly E with two     bars in the middle instead of one is represented using an image. The alternative text gives the     character's pronunciation.</p>
        <p>Only <img alt="euro " src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/euro.png" height="18" width="21">5.99!</p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;p&gt;Only &lt;img src="euro.png" alt="euro "&gt;5.99!</pre>
      </div>
      <p>An image should not be used if Unicode characters would serve an identical purpose. Only when    the text cannot be directly represented using Unicode, e.g. because of decorations or because the    character is not in the Unicode character set (as in the case of gaiji), would an image be    appropriate.</p>
      <p>If an author is tempted to use an image because their default system font does not    support a given character, then Web Fonts are a better solution than images.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>An illuminated manuscript might use graphics for some of its letters. The text alternative in     such a situation is just the character that the image represents.</p>
        <p><img alt="O" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/fancyO.png" height="32" width="24">nce upon a time and a long long time ago...</p>

      <section>
      <h3 id="images-that-include-text">Images that include text</h3>
      <p>Sometimes, an image consists of a graphics such as a chart and associated text.     In this case it is recommended that the text in the image is included in the text alternative.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>Consider an image containing  a pie chart and associated text. It is recommended wherever     possible to provide any associated text as text, not an image of text.     If this is not possible include the text in the text alternative along with the pertinent information    conveyed in the image.</p>
        <p><img alt="Figure 1. Distribution of Articles by Journal      Category. Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14%, and Science=18%." id="piechart" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/figure1.png" height="279" width="351"></p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="figure1.gif" <mark>alt="Figure 1. Distribution of Articles by Journal Category.

      </div>
      <div class="example">
        <p>Here's another example of the same <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#piechart">pie chart</a> image,     showing a short text alternative included in the <code>alt</code> attribute     and a longer text alternative in text. The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> elements are used to associate the longer text alternative with the image. The <code>alt</code> attribute is used    to label the image.</p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="figure1.gif" <mark>alt="Figure 1"</mark>&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;&lt;strong&gt;Figure 1.&lt;/strong&gt; Distribution of Articles by Journal Category.
Pie chart: Language=68%, Education=14%, and Science=18%.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;    </pre>
        <p>The advantage of this method over the previous example is that the text alternative     is available to all users at all times. It also allows structured mark up to be used in the text     alternative, where as a text alternative provided using the <code>alt</code> attribute does not.</p>

      <p>An image that isn't discussed directly by the surrounding text but still has     some relevance can be included in a page using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element. Such images     are more than mere decoration, they may augment the themes or subject matter of the page     content and so still form part of the content.

      <div class="example">

The image is a painting titled the "Lady of Shallot", it is     inspired by the poem and its subject matter is derived from the poem. Therefore it is strongly     recommended that a text alternative is provided. There is a short description of the content of     the image in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-img-alt">alt</a> attribute and    a link below the image to a longer description located at the bottom of the document.

      <p>In many cases, the image is actually just supplementary, and its presence merely reinforces the    surrounding text. In these cases, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-img-alt">alt</a> attribute must be    present but its value must be the empty string.</p>
      <p>In general, an image falls into this category if removing the image doesn't make the page any    less useful, but including the image makes it a lot easier for users of visual browsers to    understand the concept.</p>
      <div class="example">

The link points to a page containing <a href="http://www.tate.org.uk/art/artworks/waterhouse-the-lady-of-shalott-n01543">information about the painting</a>. </p>

      <p>Purely decorative images are visual enhancements, decorations, or embellishments that provide no function or information beyond aesthetics to users who can view the images.</p>
      <p>Mark up purely decorative images so they can be ignored by assistive technology by using an empty <code>alt</code> attribute (alt=""). </p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>Here's an example of an image being used as a decorative banner for a person's blog. The image offers no information and so an empty <code>alt</code> attribute is used.</p>

      <h3 id="inline">Inline images</h3>
      <p>When images are used inline as part of the flow of text in a sentence, provide a word or phrase as a text     alternative which makes sense in the context of the sentence it is a part of.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>I <img alt="love" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/heart.png" height="24" width="27"> you.</p>
        <pre class='example highlight'>I &lt;img src="heart.png" <mark>alt="love"</mark>&gt; you.</pre>

        <pre class='example highlight'>My &lt;img src="heart.png" <mark>alt="heart"</mark>&gt; breaks.</pre>
      </div>
      <p class="note">Unicode characters could be used as an alternative to inline images where appropriate. Modern browsers have support for characters like "♥" and "☺", and support the use of custom fonts to render those as colored image fonts, or an author can use image replacement techniques.</p>

      <p>When a picture has been sliced into smaller image files that are then displayed    together to form the complete picture again, include a text alternative for one    of the images using the <code>alt</code> attribute as per the relevant
      guidance for the picture as a whole, and then include an empty <code>alt</code>    attribute on the other images.</p>
      <div class="example">
        <p>In this example, a picture representing a company logo for the <em>PIP Corporation</em> has been split into two pieces, the first containing the letters "PIP" and the second with the word "CO".    The text alternative <em>PIP CO</em> is in the <code>alt</code> attribute of the first image.</p>
        <p><img alt="Image containing the text 'PIP'." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/pip.gif" height="64" width="99"><img alt="Image containing the text 'CO'." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/co.gif" height="64" width="103"></p>

        <p>In the following example, a rating is shown as three filled    stars and two empty stars. While the text alternative could have    been "★★★☆☆", the author has    instead decided to more helpfully give the rating in the form "3    out of 5". That is the text alternative of the first image, and the    rest have empty <code>alt</code> attributes.</p>
        <p><img alt="3 out of 5." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/rating.png" height="30" width="149"></p>

  <h3 id="image-maps-0">Image maps</h3>
If an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element has a usemap attribute which references a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-map-element">map</a> element containing <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-area-element">area</a> elements that have href attributes, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> is considered to be interactive content.    In such cases, always provide a text alternative for the image using the <code>alt</code> attribute.
<div class="example">
  <p>Consider the following image which is a map of <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Katoomba,_New_South_Wales">Katoomba</a>,      it has 2 interactive regions corresponding to the areas of North and South Katoomba:</p>
  <p><img alt="Map of Katoomba." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/imagemap.png" usemap="#Map" height="249" width="209"></p>
  <map name="Map">

  </map>
  <p>The text alternative is a brief description of the image. The <code>alt</code> attribute on each     of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-area-element">area</a> elements provides text describing the content of the target page of each linked region:</p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;p&gt;View houses for sale in North Katoomba or South Katoomba:&lt;/p&gt;
&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="imagemap.png" width="209" alt="Map of Katoomba" height="249" usemap="#Map"&gt;

<h3 id="a-group-of-images-that-form-a-single-larger-picture-with-links">A group of images that form a single larger picture with links</h3>
<p>Sometimes, when you create a composite picture from multiple images, you may wish to     link one or more of the images. Provide an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-img-alt">alt</a> attribute     for each linked image to describe the purpose of the link. </p>
<div class="example">
  <p>In the following example, a composite picture is used to represent a "crocoduck"; a fictional creature which    defies evolutionary principles by being part crocodile and part duck. You are asked to interact with the    crocoduck, but you need to exercise caution...</p>
  <p><img alt="crocodile's angry, chomping head" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/crocoduck1.png"><img alt="duck's soft, feathery body" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/crocoduck2.png"></p>

&lt;p&gt;You encounter a strange creature called a "crocoduck". The creature seems angry!
Perhaps some friendly stroking will help to calm it, but be careful not to stroke
any crocodile parts. This would just enrage the beast further.&lt;/p&gt;

<h3 id="images-of-pictures">Images of Pictures</h3>
<p>Images of pictures or graphics include visual representations of objects, people, scenes, abstractions, etc.      This <a>non-text content</a> can convey a significant amount of    information visually or provide a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#sensoryexpdef">specific sensory experience</a> [[!WCAG20]] to     a sighted person. Examples include photographs, paintings, drawings and artwork.</p>


<p>An appropriate text alternative for a picture is a brief description, or <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#namedef">name</a> [[!WCAG20]].   As in all text alternative authoring decisions, writing suitable text   alternatives for pictures requires     human judgment. The text value is subjective to the context where the   image is used and the page author's writing style. Therefore,     there is no single 'right' or 'correct' piece of alt text   for any particular image. In  addition to providing a short text     alternative that gives a brief description of the non-text content,   also providing supplemental content through another means when     appropriate may be useful.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This first example shows an image uploaded to a photo-sharing site. The photo is of a cat, sitting in the bath. The image has a     text alternative provided using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element's <code>alt</code> attribute. It also has a caption provided by including     the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> element and using a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element to identify the caption text.</p>
  <p><img alt="Lola the cat sitting under an umbrella in the bath tub." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/lola.png" height="242" width="300"></p>
  <p>Lola prefers a bath to a shower.</p>

&lt;figcaption&gt;Lola prefers a bath to a shower.&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;    </pre>
</div>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example is of an image that defies a complete description, as the subject of the image is open to interpretation.    The image has a text alternative in the <code>alt</code> attribute which gives users who cannot view the image a sense     of what the image is. It also has a caption provided by including the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> element and using a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element to identify the caption text.</p>

<h3 id="webcam-images">Webcam images</h3>
<p>Webcam images are static images that are automatically updated periodically. Typically the images are    from a fixed viewpoint, the images may update on the page automatically as each new image is uploaded from    the camera or the user may be required to refresh the page to view an updated image. Examples include traffic    and weather cameras.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example is fairly typical; the title and a time stamp are included in the image, automatically generated    by the webcam software. It would be better if the text information was not included in the image, but as it is part    of the image, include it as part of the text alternative. A caption is also provided using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> elements.  As the image is provided to give a visual indication of the   current weather near a building,    a link to a local weather forecast is provided, as with automatically   generated and uploaded webcam images it may be impractical to    provide such information as a text alternative.</p>
  <p>The text of the <code>alt</code> attribute includes a prose version of the timestamp, designed to make the text more    understandable when announced by text to speech software.  The text alternative also includes a description of some aspects    of what can be seen in the image which are unchanging, although weather conditions and time of day change.</p>

<h3 id="when-a-text-alternative-is-not-available-at-the-time-of-publication">When a text alternative is not available at the time of publication</h3>
<p>In some cases an image is included in a published document, but the   author is unable to provide an appropriate text alternative.     In such cases the minimum requirement is to provide a caption for the   image using the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> elements under the following conditions:</p>
<ul id="figcaption-as-alt-condition">
  <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element is in a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> element </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> element contains a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element </li>
  <li>The <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element contains content other than inter-element whitespace </li>
  <li>Ignoring the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element and its descendants, the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> element has no <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/infrastructure.html#text-0">Text</a> node descendants other than inter-element whitespace, and no     embedded content descendant other than the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element. </li>
</ul>
<p>In other words, the only content of the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figure-element">figure</a> is an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element and a <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element, and the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element must include (caption) content.</p>
<p>Such cases are to be kept to an absolute      minimum. If there is even the slightest possibility of the author      having the ability to provide real alternative text, then it would      not be acceptable to omit the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-img-alt">alt</a> attribute.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>In this example, a person uploads a photo, as part of a bulk upload   of many images, to a photo sharing site. The user has not    provided a text alternative or a caption for the image. The site's   authoring tool inserts a caption automatically using whatever useful    information it has for the image. In this case it's the file name and   date the photo was taken.</p>
  <p class="warning">The caption text in the example below is not a suitable text alternative and is not conforming to the Web Accessibility Guidelines 2.0. [[!WCAG20]]</p>
  <p><img alt="no text alternative provided" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/clara.png" height="258" width="300"></p>

&lt;figcaption&gt;<mark>clara.jpg, taken on 12/11/2010.</mark>&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;    </pre>
  <p>Notice that even in this example, as much useful information      as possible is still included in the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/grouping-content.html#the-figcaption-element">figcaption</a> element.</p>
</div>
<div class="example">
  <p>In this second example, a person uploads a photo to a photo sharing site. She has provided    a caption for the image but not a text alternative. This may be because the site does not provide users with the ability    to add a text alternative in the <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>
  <p><img alt="no text alternative provided" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/elo.png" height="250" width="205"></p>
  <p><strong>Eloisa with Princess Belle</strong></p>

&lt;figcaption&gt;<mark>Eloisa with Princess Belle</mark>&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;    </pre>
</div>
<div class="example">
  <p>Sometimes the entire point of the image is that a textual    description is not available, and the user is to provide the    description. For example, software that displays images and    asks for alternative text precisely for the purpose of then    writing a page with correct alternative text. Such a page could    have a table of images, like this:</p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;table&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;th&gt; Image
&lt;th&gt; Description

&lt;figcaption&gt;Image 640 by 100, filename 'banner.gif'&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;input name="alt2421"&gt;
&lt;tr&gt;
&lt;td&gt;
&lt;figure&gt;
&lt;img src="2422.png"&gt;
&lt;figcaption&gt;Image 200 by 480, filename 'ad3.gif'&lt;/figcaption&gt;
&lt;/figure&gt;
&lt;td&gt; &lt;input name="alt2422"&gt;
&lt;/table&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p class="note">Since some users cannot use images at all (e.g. because they are blind) the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-img-alt">alt</a> attribute is only allowed to be omitted when no text     alternative is available and none can be made available, as in the above examples.</p>

<h3 id="an-image-not-intended-for-the-user">An image not intended for the user</h3>
<p>Generally authors should avoid using <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> elements    for purposes other than showing images.</p>
<p>If an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element is being used for purposes other    than showing an image, e.g. as part of a service to count page    views, use an empty <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-img-alt">alt</a> attribute.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>An example of an <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element used to collect web page statistics.    The <code>alt</code> attribute is empty as the image has no meaning.</p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;img src="http://server3.stats.com/count.pl?NeonMeatDream.com" width="0" height="0" <mark>alt=""</mark>&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>It is recommended for the example use above the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-dim-width">width</a> and <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#attr-dim-height">height</a> attributes  be set to zero.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>Another example use is when an image such as a <em>spacer.gif</em> is used to aid positioning of content.     The <code>alt</code> attribute is empty as the image has no meaning.</p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;img src="spacer.gif" width="10" height="10" <mark>alt=""</mark>&gt;</pre>

<h3 id="icon-images">Icon Images</h3>
<p>An icon is usually a simple picture representing a program, action, data file or a concept.     Icons are intended to help users of visual browsers to recognize features at a glance.</p>
<p>Use an empty <code>alt</code> attribute when an icon is supplemental to    text conveying the same meaning.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>In this example, we have a link pointing to a site's home page, the link contains a    house icon image and the text "home". The image has an empty <code>alt</code> text.    Where images are used in this way, it would also be appropriate to add the image using CSS</p>
  <p><img alt="A house icon next to the word 'home'." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/home.png" height="38" width="100"></p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;a href="home.html"&gt;&lt;img src="home.gif" width="15" height="15" <mark>alt=""</mark>&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;

#home:before { content: url(home.png);}

&lt;a href="home.html" id="home"&gt;Home&lt;/a&gt;  </pre>
</div>
<div class="example" id="hba" tabindex="-1">
  <p>In this example, there is a warning message, with a warning icon. The word "Warning!" is in emphasized    text next to the icon. As the information conveyed by the icon is redundant the <a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/embedded-content.html#the-img-element">img</a> element is given in an empty <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>
  <p><img alt="Warning!" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/warning.png" height="34" width="38"><strong>Warning!</strong> Your session is about to expire.</p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="warning.png" width="15" height="15" <mark>alt=""</mark>&gt;
&lt;strong&gt;Warning!&lt;/strong&gt; Your session is about to expire&lt;/p&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>When an icon conveys additional information not available in text, provide a text alternative.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>In this example, there is a warning message, with a warning icon. The icon emphasizes the    importance of the message and identifies it as a particular type of content.</p>
  <p><img alt="Warning!" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/warning.png" height="34" width="38"><strong>Your session is about to expire.</strong></p>

<h3 id="logos,-insignia,-flags,-or-emblems">Logos, insignia, flags, or emblems</h3>
<p>Many pages include logos, insignia, flags, or emblems, which stand for a company, organization, project,     band, software package, country, or other entity. What can be considered as an appropriate text alternative depends upon,     like all images, the context in which the image is being used and what function it serves in the given context.</p>
<p>If a logo is the sole content of a link, provide a brief description of the link target in the <code>alt</code> attribute.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example illustrates the use of the HTML5 logo as the sole content of a link to the HTML specification.</p>
  <p><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/"> <img alt="HTML 5.1 Nightly specification" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/HTML5_Logo.png" height="128" width="128"></a></p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;a href="http://dev.w3.org/html5/spec/spec.html"&gt;&lt;img src="HTML5_Logo.png" <mark>alt="HTML 5.1 specification"</mark>&gt;&lt;/a&gt;</pre>
</div>
<p>If a logo is being used to represent the entity, e.g. as a page heading, provide the name of the     entity being represented by the logo as the text alternative.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example illustrates the use of the WebPlatform.org logo being used to represent itself.</p>
  <p><img alt="WebPlatform.org" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/logo-with-text.png" height="100" width="110"> and other developer resources</p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;h2&gt;&lt;img src="images/webplatform.png" <mark>alt="WebPlatform.org"</mark>&gt; and other developer resources&lt;h2&gt;</pre>
  <p>The text alternative in the example above could also include the word "logo" to describe the type of image content.     If so, it is suggested that square brackets be used to delineate this information: <code>alt="[logo] WebPlatform.org"</code>.</p>
</div>
<p>If a logo is being used next to the name of the entity it represents, then the logo is supplemental.     Include an empty <code>alt</code> attribute as the text alternative is already provided.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example illustrates the use of a logo next to the name of the organization it represents.</p>
  <p><img alt="" src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/webplatform.png" height="68" width="72"> WebPlatform.org</p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;img src="images/webplatform1.png" <mark>alt=""</mark>&gt; WebPlatform.org</pre>
</div>
<p>If the logo is used alongside text discussing the subject or entity the logo represents, then provide     a text alternative which describes the logo.</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example illustrates the use of a logo next to text discussing the subject the logo represents.</p>
  <p><img alt="HTML5 logo: Shaped like a shield with the     text 'HTML' above and the numeral '5' prominent on the face of the shield." src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/HTML5_Logo.png" height="128" width="128"></p>
  <p><strong>HTML5</strong> is a language for structuring and presenting content for the World       Wide Web, a core technology of the Internet. It is the latest revision of the HTML standard      (originally created in 1990 and most recently standardized as HTML4 in 1997) and currently remains      under development. Its core aims have been to improve the language with support for the latest      multimedia while keeping it easily readable by humans and consistently understood by computers and      devices (web browsers, parsers etc.). </p>
  <pre class='example highlight'>&lt;p&gt;&lt;img src="HTML5_Logo.png"

  <h3 id="captcha-images">CAPTCHA Images</h3>
<p>CAPTCHA stands for "Completely Automated Public Turing test to tell Computers and Humans Apart".    CAPTCHA images are used for security purposes to confirm that content is being accessed by a person    rather than a computer. This authentication is done through visual verification of an image. CAPTCHA     typically presents an image with characters or words in it that the user is to re-type. The image is     usually distorted and has some noise applied to it to make the characters difficult to read.</p>
<p>To improve the accessibility of CAPTCHA provide text alternatives   that identify and describe the purpose of the image, and provide   alternative     forms of the CAPTCHA using output modes for different types of sensory   perception. For instance provide     an audio alternative along with the visual image. Place the audio   option right next to the visual one.     This helps but is still problematic for people without sound cards,   the deaf-blind, and some people with limited hearing.     Another method is to include a form that asks a question along with   the visual image. This helps but can be     problematic for people with cognitive impairments.</p>
<p class="warning">It is strongly recommended that alternatives to CAPTCHA be used, as all forms of CAPTCHA introduce     unacceptable barriers to entry for users with disabilities. For further information, see [[TURINGTEST]].</p>
<div class="example">
  <p>This example shows a CAPTCHA test which uses a distorted image of text. The text alternative in the     <code>alt</code> attribute provides instructions for a user in the case where she cannot access the image content. </p>
  <p><img alt="captcha containing the words 'aides' and 'sprucest'. The letters are distorted and the color of the letters and background is partially inverted," src="http://www.w3.org/TR/html/images/captcha.png" height="60" width="270"></p>

  <section>
  <h3 id="native">Native HTML methods</h3>

    <h3 id="altmethod">The img element <code>alt</code> attribute</h3>
    <p>The primary method for providing text alternatives for images is by including text in the img element <code>alt</code> attribute.  In graphical   browsers the content of the <code>alt</code> attribute is typically displayed along with an indication (bordered area and/or an image icon) of the presence of an image when the image is not displayed, because the user has disabled image display or the image source information is incorrect. Assistive technologies such as screen readers will typically announce the presence of an image followed by the <code>alt</code> attribute content. Text based browsers  may display the <code>alt</code> attribute content  in brackets or in  different colored text or as the content of a link to the image or as text without any indication of the image or  prefixed with an indication of the image.</p>

      <UL>
        <LI>An image is contained within a <code>figure</code> element and has an associated caption provided using the <code>figcaption</code> element. Using an empty <code>alt</code> attribute hides an image from some users. If an image has a caption the image needs to be discoverable by users, otherwise a caption is present that refers to nothing for some users.</LI>
        <LI>An image contains relevant information not available in the same document as text. Using an empty <code>alt</code> attribute hides an image from some users. In order to have the possibility of interrogating the image, the image must be discoverable.</LI>
        <LI>An image contains relevant information,  an alternative interpretation of which is available in the same document as structured text. Using an empty <code>alt</code> attribute hides an image from some users, which is incorrect. The image is not meaningless, it  contains information which a range of users could interpret with the  aid of the short text alternative and longer description. It also provides a text  alternative for users who have images turned off in their browsers, so  they can, if they wish, load and view the image. If an empty <code>alt</code> attribute is present  there may be no indication that an image is present. Furthermore if a description of an image is provided in a document, a <A href="/#hpa">programmatic association</A> between the image and the descriptive text is required.

  <p>Gaiji is a term meaning "external characters".  In general, this means characters that are not represented in existing Japanese
  encoding systems such as [[UNICODE]].</p>
  <ul>
    <li>When gaiji is used as a "hack" to display a character that is adequately represented by a real Unicode character, the recommended practice is to remove the gaiji image and just use the Unicode character.
    </li>
    <li>When gaiji is used to display a character that is not available in a particular font, the alternative text should be the Unicode character.
    </li>
    <li>When gaiji is used to represent a graphical image similar to those displaying emoji, use a short description of the image's content (e.g. "thumbs up", "sunrise", or "smiling woman").
    </li>
    <li>When gaiji is used to represent a new or made-up character that has no Unicode representation, use the phonetic hiragana or katakana string to represent the pronunciation of the new or made-up character. </li>

<p>Information and sensory experience to be communicated to the user by means of a user agent such as a web browser, including code or markup that defines the content's structure, presentation, and interactions. </p>
<h3 id="hpa">programmatic association</h3>
<p>It must  be possible for people using assistive technologies to find   the text alternative for an image when they encounter the image that they cannot   use. To accomplish this,  the text must be "programmatically associated" with the image and is referenced as <dfn>programmatic association</dfn>. This means that the user must be able to   use their assistive technology to find the alternative text (that they can use)   when they land on the image (that they can't use).</p>
<h3 id="hbs">non-text content</h3>
<p>A <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#non-text-contentdef">non-text content</a></dfn> is any content that is not a sequence of characters that can be programmatically determined or where the sequence is not expressing something in human language </p>
<p>Note: This includes ASCII Art (which is a pattern of characters), emoticons, leetspeak (which uses character substitution), and images representing text. </p>
<h3 id="hbt">Empty <code>alt</code> attribute or null <code>alt</code> attribute.</h3>
<p>An <code>alt</code> attribute with no content:</p>
<pre class='example highlight'>
&lt;img src="null.gif" <mark>alt=""</mark>&gt;
</pre>
<h3 id="hbu">Text alternative</h3>
<p><dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/#textdef">Text</a></dfn> that is   programmatically associated with <a>non-text content</a> or referred to from text that is programmatically associated with non-text content. Programmatically associated text is text whose location can be <dfn><a href="http://www.w3.org/TR/UNDERSTANDING-WCAG20/conformance.html#uc-programmatically-determined-head">programmatically determined</a></dfn> from the non-text content.
